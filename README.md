Music Analysis
--------------
Braeden Treutel

Type in any artist recognized by Spotify and see a list of their top 10 most popular songs

Uses spotify's search to identify the most likely artist you are intending to find i.e. searching 'Beatles' will still identify 'The Beatles'

Uses spotify web api, python/flask, html, and css

This is useful because Spotify only shows 5 popular, trending songs (in no particular order) of any artist when you look at their profile.
